# Carla ROS Image Converter



The ```carla_ros_image_converter``` package is used to convert images from a ROS Topic to an OpenCV image by running the following command:



    roslaunch carla_ros_image_converter image_converter.launch



In the future we will be using the OpenCV Template Matching algorithm in order to track objects in the CARLA world.
